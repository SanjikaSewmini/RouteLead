# Profile Update Error - Fix Documentation

## Issue Analysis
The PersonalInformation page is experiencing a 400 error when saving profile data due to backend enum handling issues.

## Root Cause
The error occurs because:
1. ✅ **Fixed**: Frontend was sending "Male" instead of "MALE" (gender enum format)
2. ✅ **Fixed**: Phone number validation issues (leading zero)
3. ❌ **Backend Issue**: PostgreSQL enum casting error with gender_enum column

## Error Details
```
ERROR: column "gender" is of type gender_enum but expression is of type character varying
Hint: You will need to rewrite or cast the expression.
```

This suggests a database schema mismatch or JPA/Hibernate enum handling issue.

## Immediate Workaround Applied

### Frontend Changes (PersonalInformation.tsx):
1. **Fixed Gender Format**: Changed from "Male"/"Female" to "MALE"/"FEMALE"
2. **Fixed Phone Number**: Remove leading zero (0768909175 → 768909175)
3. **Temporarily Excluded Problematic Fields**: Gender and dateOfBirth excluded from update
4. **Improved Error Handling**: More specific error messages for users

### Current Working Fields:
- ✅ First Name
- ✅ Last Name  
- ✅ Phone Number (without leading 0)
- ✅ Email Address
- ✅ Address Line 1
- ✅ Address Line 2 (Optional)
- ✅ City

### Temporarily Disabled Fields:
- ❌ Gender (backend enum issue)
- ❌ Date of Birth (backend enum issue)

## User Experience
The profile update will now work for basic contact information and addresses. Gender and date of birth will be handled in the UI but not saved until the backend issue is resolved.

## Recommended Backend Fix
The backend team should investigate:
1. Database schema for gender_enum type
2. JPA entity mapping for GenderEnum
3. Hibernate enum handling configuration
4. Consider using @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING) with proper column definition

## Testing Results
- ✅ Profile data loading works correctly
- ✅ Form pre-population works
- ✅ Basic profile fields can be updated
- ✅ Success navigation and animation work
- ❌ Gender/DOB updates need backend fix

The core functionality is working, with a temporary limitation on enum fields.
