## 🚀 READY FOR USE - Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Execute Supabase Storage Setup**: Run `fe/scripts/setup-supabase-storage.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test Complete Flow**: Upload documents → Submit for Review → Verify status changes
3. **Admin Testing**: Test admin approval workflow

### System Features Implemented:

#### 🔒 Security Features
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) for user document isolation
- ✅ Private storage bucket with proper MIME type restrictions  
- ✅ JWT authentication integration
- ✅ Admin-only access to all documents for review

#### 📱 User Experience Features  
- ✅ Intuitive upload interface with progress tracking
- ✅ Success animations matching existing app design
- ✅ Clear status indicators (Not Verified/Pending/Verified)
- ✅ Access control preventing edits when verified

#### 🗂️ File Management
- ✅ Organized storage structure: `userId/documentType/filename`
- ✅ Automatic file naming with timestamps
- ✅ Support for images (JPEG, PNG) and PDFs
- ✅ 10MB file size limit with validation

#### 🔄 Verification Workflow
- ✅ **Initial**: NULL → "Not Verified" (red, can upload)
- ✅ **Uploaded**: Documents stored in Supabase Storage
- ✅ **Submitted**: PENDING → "Pending" (yellow, can edit)  
- ✅ **Approved**: VERIFIED → "Verified" (green, read-only)

#### 🛠️ Technical Architecture
- ✅ **Backend**: Spring Boot with comprehensive verification APIs
- ✅ **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- ✅ **Storage**: Supabase Storage with RLS policies
- ✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with enum-based status management
